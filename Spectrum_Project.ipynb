It’s all a spook. The “bored bourgeoisie” were the ones living as we do today, with enough time to dedicate to contemplation. Of course they were the only ones with the time to realize what we are only starting to realize now.

            "Philosophers have done away with causality for centuries now, but commoners still believe in it. They see us and our writings as &quot;absurd&quot;, or at the most &quot;magical&quot;, but its their causality that is magic. So let me try to explain one last time to you low-IQ buffoons why your Richard Dawkins Anglo Cabbage Head logic is dumb as fuck and you are dumb as doorknobs for still believing it in the 21st century. This is the last chance youll get to grasp this, and if you fail to give this explanation to the roving gangs of murder-drones well soon be sending out, youre toast! So pay attention! What is the cause of something? Its something else. But weve already agreed that everything in the universe is connected to and affects everything else, otherwise they wouldnt be part of the same universe. So the cause of anything... is everything. But &quot;everything&quot; is precisely the definition of universe. So the cause of anything is the universe. But the universe cannot be pointed to as cause, because... it cant be pointed to. The universe is not in your room, or outside your door, or even in the sky. So it is magical thinking to believe that some thing caused something else, and that all the other things in the universe had nothing to do with it. So causality is magical thinking, which is fantasy, which is a desire, which is will. You WANT that things cause to be that other thing, and that is all. I can &quot;prove&quot; that Muslims created Western civilization if I want. But I dont want to. So I wont. Think also of chaos theory and the butterfly flapping its wings creating a cyclone and so on. Think also of the epistemological scepticism of Hume and Kant. All these things say the same thing. We are not logically entitled to draw inferences from circumstances. Just because something happened doesnt mean it will happen again. Indeed, its proof positive that it wont happen again before the next Recurrence! How can there be &quot;laws&quot; of &quot;nature&quot; in a universe in which repetition is impossible! Moreover, causality would make the universe deterministic. If you could find the true cause of one thing you could calculate all other things from that and win the game. Thats why we are reduced to chances and quantum theory and ultimately Zarathustras dice-throwers. Its not an accident that the ultimate philosopher likes gambling! Its also not an accident that the subhuman hates gambling and regards it as the devil. The subhuman wants to calculate! The subhuman wants the &quot;sure thing&quot;! And of course whoever insists on the sure thing doesnt deserve anything. He deserves slavery, and thats why he gets precisely that.\n",

            "Free Will refers to the ability of conscious agents to realize one of multiple, genuinely possible alternatives by arbitrary fiat. It is incompatible with determinism because determinism allows for only a single, predetermined outcome for any &quot;choice&quot;, which renders the intuition that on certain occasions we really could have done otherwise, even everything else being equal, ultimately illusory. There are compatibilist definitions of free will where there is no such conflict, but I find them uninteresting because they dont pertain to the question of the veracity of said intuition.\n",
            "genuinely possible alternativescould have done otherwiseBoth very ambiguous phrases. Both can be interpreted in such a way that determinism conflicts with free will, and also in such a way that there is no conflict at all.Take the second phrase. On the one hand it can mean that there is more than one choice that you could have taken if you had wanted to take it. On the other hand, it can mean that if the exact same person is put in the exact same situation over and over again, they would sometimes choose one option and sometimes a different one.The former interpretation of the phrase is a compatibilist one; the latter an incompatibilist one. However, the second interpretation is misleading in that its not about whether or not you COULD choose otherwise, its about whether or not you WOULD choose otherwise. Whats more, if its true that we &quot;could have chosen otherwise&quot; under the second interpretation, it wouldnt actually give us less agency over our choices, since it would mean that our choices are made based on a roll of the metaphysical dice, not based on our own preferences. Thus it is only the compatibilist interpretation of &quot;could have done otherwise&quot; which is necessary for free will.\n",
            "When incompatibilist definitions of free will are fully parsed out and all their implications identified, it becomes apparent that theyre not valid definitions of &quot;free will&quot;, because if we actually had what incompatibilists call &quot;free will&quot; we would actually be less capable of making choices that we would be without it.\n",

            "Here i will quote an overview from engels.We all know that at the beginning of society, products are consumed by the producers themselves, and that these producers are spontaneously organized in more or less communistic communities; that the exchange of the surplus of these products with strangers, which ushers in the conversion of products into commodities, is of a later date; that it takes places at first only between individual communities of different tribes, but later also prevails within the community, and contributes considerably to the latters dissolution into bigger or smaller family groups. But even after this dissolution, the exchanging family heads remain working peasants, who produce almost all they require with the aid of their families on their own farmsteads, and get only a slight portion of the required necessities from the outside in exchange for surplus products of their own. The family is engaged not only in agriculture and livestock-raising; it also works their products up into finished articles of consumption; now and then it even does its own milling with the hand-mill; it bakes bread, spins, dyes, weaves flax and wool, tans leather, builds and repairs wooden buildings, makes tools and utensils, and not infrequently does joinery and blacksmithing; so that the family, or family group, is in the main self-sufficient.\n",
            "The little that such a family had to obtain by barter or buy from outside, even up to the beginning of the 19th century in Germany, consisted principally of the objects of handicraft production — that is, such things the nature of whose manufacture was by no means unknown to the peasant, and which he did not produce himself only because he lacked the raw material or because the purchased article was much better or very much cheaper. Hence, the peasant of the Middle Ages knew fairly accurately the labor-time required for the manufacture of the articles obtained by him in barter. The smith and the cartwright of the village worked under his eyes; likewise, the tailor and shoemaker — who in my youth still paid their visits to our Rhine peasants, one after another, turning home-made materials into shoes and clothing. The peasants, as well as the people from whom they bought, were themselves workers; the exchanged articles were each ones own products. What had they expended in making these products? Labor and labor alone: to replace tools, to produce raw material, and to process it, they spent nothing but their own labor-power; how then could they exchange these products of theirs for those of other laboring producers otherwise than in the ratio of labor expended on them? Not only was the labor-time spent on these products the only suitable measure for the quantitative determination of the values to be exchanged: no other way was at all possible. Or is it believed that the peasant and the artisan were so stupid as to give up the product of 10 hours labor of one person for that of a single hours labor of another? No other exchange is possible in the whole period of peasant natural economy than that in which the exchanged quantities of commodities tend to be measured more and more according to the amounts of labor embodied in them. From the moment money penetrates into this mode of economy, the tendency towards adaptation to the law of value (in the Marxian formulation, nota bene!) grows more pronounced on the one hand, while on the other it is already interrupted by the interference of usurers capital and fleecing by taxation; the periods for which prices, on average, approach to within a negligible margin of values, begin to grow longer.\n",

I laugh in the darkness of my basement at funny frog posts. I never post. I only lurk. I do not know what to write about in this novel, as you have already guessed my dear per·spi·ca·cious reader. I had no idea that word existed in english. Thanks American Heritage Dictionary, you are always helpful.I guess I can write about a book I read lately. Does that sound good, highly esteemed reader? I read Pantagruel. This giant is the son of the giant Gargantua, who is the male heir of Grandgousier. I don’t why he befriended that mean human named Panurge. He wanted to form a beast with two backs with a woman with a higher status in Paris. She refused his advances and he did not take her rejection lightly. What did Panurge do about this situation? He perfumed her with a strong stench and all the dogs of Paris started to urinate with violent passion on her. They ruined her! That was very mean. Poor woman, she did not deserve that. Panurge is also funny sometimes. He said that a woman going bananas at mass meant she is downy in her fanny. Pfft hahaha! He also said that the best way to defend Paris was to build huge walls made of stenchy kallbistrises (an old way to express the female’s sexual genital) with gonorrhea. I urinate on Paris. Well I am sure I once urinated in Paris. Gargantua did use his gargantuesque tail to do so. It was torrential. An almost biblical deluge. Anyway, the book covers a lot of urinary and fecal matter. My bladder is holding tightly urineFor the moment it is inI release the internal gateThe torrent pushes its weightWhat a blissI am urinating on Paris!By François Rabelais, age 41 or 52Gargantua had to choose between happiness and grief when his son was born and his wife had died due to complications. He made the right choice. Why should he be sad when God blessed him with a healthy son. He will meet her in heaven afterwards. Gargantua is a good father and Pantagruel is a good son.

Let people write what theyre gonna write, invite collaborators in a configurable manner but ultimately they own it, then let people riff on the final product (using copies, not editing the original) and let the group as a whole decide whats best. With the political essay for example, I would love to see a rendition with snarky notes on top of it. Id choose that over the original. But with our current setup we have to treat the essay like sacred space and leave it untouched, or be a dick and edit something that isnt ours. Not good options for a pleasant final product.Maybe a happy in-between for now is let anons submit their edits in standalone documents and we vote on each piece one at a time.

            "In contemporary society a great deal of consideration, of tact and forbearance, of good-natured respect for the rights of others, even for the claims of others, is quite widespread; even more, a certain benevolent instinctive estimation of human value in general, which finds expression in trustfulness and credit of all kinds. Respect for man—and not merely for virtuous men—is perhaps what divides us most sharply from a Christian evaluation. It seems to us ironic to a degree when we still hear morals preached; a man lowers himself in our eyes and becomes comical if he preaches morals. This moral liberality is one of the best signs of our age. When we discover cases in which it is noticeably lacking, this strikes us as a kind of sickness (the case of Carlyle in England, the case of Ibsen in Norway, the case of Schopenhauerian pessimism throughout Europe). If anything can reconcile us to our age, it is the great amount of immorality it permits itself without thinking any the worse of itself. On the contrary! What constitutes the superiority of culture over unculture? of the Renaissance over the Middle Ages, for example?—One thing alone: the great amount of admitted immorality. From this it follows of necessity what all the heights of human evolution must represent to the eye of the moral fanatic: the non plus ultra of corruption (—consider Savonarolas judgment of Florence, Platos judgment of Periclean Athens, Luthers judgment of Rome, Rousseaus judgment of Voltaires society, the German judgment contra Goethe).In great men, the specific qualities of life—injustice, falsehood, exploitation—are at their greatest. But in so far as they have had an overwhelming effect, their essence has been most misunderstood and interpreted as goodness. Type: Carlyle as interpreter.From Will to Power.\n",

Of the mid length poems and verse dramas I rec Beppo, The Giaour, Lara, Mazeppa, The Prisoner of Chillon, Manfred, Sardanapalus (this inspired Delacroixs famous painting), and Cain. The satires are okay but not among his best verse, barring Don Juan of course which doubles loosely as a wonderfully directionless adventure novel (Fitz-Fulke!) which reminds me-- Byron did begin a 17th canto for Juan which many single editions do not include, between 10 and 15 stanzas, I believe, if youre curious.I suppose my favorite Romantics are essayists- Coleridges unfinished Biographia is my favorite long form attempt, and DeQuinceys English Mail Coach the piece that I admire most of every work can that time period.

There is only the appearance of consistency upon repeated observation of a given happening, or, rather (since a happening only seems happen once) consistency between several similar happenings.When you throw an egg, it usually breaks. Therefore, you can predict that any egg you throw in the future will break. No mathematically-precise knowledge of physics is needed for this. Such knowledge simply increases predictive power. But knowledge of physics hinges upon axiomatic physical laws. What if the physical laws were to change? Well, they havent in the past 13 billion years, as far as we can tell. But if they were to, what would that mean. More importantly. What causes our universe to have the precise set of physical laws that it does? Why does it have any physical laws at all. If nothing existed, then there would be no physical laws. But something exists, and it does. Is there an equal-and-opposite universe whose physical laws balance and compliment our own? It would seem to make sense. The question for why there is something rather than nothing seems to be answered when we consider that everything which exists is the void expressing itself in terms of what it is not. The void abides. The void is eternal. Nothingness lasts. Somethingness decays back into nothingness. The void is real. The matter is fake. Matter is maya. The void is Brahman. Perceived truth is only a temporary consistency of outcomes, and that consistency of outcomes is so very temporary against the face of eternity. The real truth is that there is no truth, and that nothing lasts forever. The void lasts forever. Simple. Succinct. Balanced.

There was nobody around, and the mug looked really nice and ornate, like a handmade clay mug. The bottom had some etchings about it being artisanal. It had just a little tea left in it. I reasoned that somebody for some reason further up the path had left it there. I reasoned that it might make a nice gift to my mother, but I simultaneously struggled with the notion that I might be stealing the mug. I moved it off the path a few feet into the grass and then got back on my bike and continued riding. I reasoned that if the people who left it there wanted it they would take it. I eventually passed a woman and man coming back the opposite way with two dogs. I figured they might be the owners of the cup. I stopped for awhile once i had gotten past them, and gathered some flowers from a ditch. I waited for awhile then rode back the way I came. I arrived back at the spot I left the mug, and found it still there. The cars were all gone at the rest stop, so I figured the people who owned it must have left.

Hes my favorite because the other three get really frustrated by his antics and I think its hilarious. I actually have a lot of fun when we get distracted and go on tangents because its soo bonkers and silly, and the exasperation and frustration of the other three sends me into fits of giggles. But when they start getting really upset and we have to focus and keep &quot;playing&quot; it sucks. The story is so lame and I dont care about it at all. Im not engaged with the campaign or my character or anyone elses character besides the hyperactive turbo nerd (whos nearing 30 btw) whos character is hilarious. I really just want to hang out with these doofuses and not have to pretend to be into the hole roleplay thing. theres just something soul crushing about trying to play make-pretend when youre rapidly approaching 30....\n",
            "So, I’ve been reading or referring back to Mark Fisher, his lost future thing about how it’s so difficult for artists to create variations of something new—it’s been done, art has been so experimented with, especially writing, there’s only so much to experiment with and it’s been done, the heavy experimenting especially came around in post-modern literature.So, while we cannot create something “new” particularly, we can cater to the new audience, the audiences of the younger generations (under 25 years of age—children of the 90s and millennials), the &quot;younger&quot; readers we have now. So we’re not inventing anything &quot;new&quot; any more, no matter how much experimenting, but we have to rather build something new for a new audience.And these generations—theyre full of unique boredom, post-post-modern boredom, and these attention spans are so short—they are accustomed to receiving information in little bursts from social media. The Internet has revolutionized writing, and has completely reinvented the mind of the reader. I don’t meet a lot of people of this age who really actually read books for pleasure, but they all read social media. It’s scrolling new content to new content and they’re all little bursts.We have a generation of people here who really read nothing but non-fiction narratives in short bursts. We are living in an era of non-fiction readers. And I am doing my best to keep these trends in mind as I’m writing for this new reader, the reader of [my] generation and probably generations to come.\n",

            "Mother’s Day was really fun. Both my sister and I are home for quarantine with mom and dad for the time being. We all got up and made a giant breakfast: pancakes, eggs, bacon, fresh fruit, lox and bages, sautéed veggies, everything. It was really nice outside today, and my mom wanted to get the patio space and yard all ready for the summer, so we cleaned out everything from the shitty New England winter now that it’s warm enough here in eastern MA. We were gonna go for a walk down at some local conservation land with the dog but never got around to it, because we were having fun just finding small projects to finish together. They were like little missions, broken things and dirty things that needed righting, and added to the comfort of the space when righted. I split wood for the bonfire, fixed the leg of a broken patio table with some epoxy and a vice, and I re-fastened my mom’s favorite wind chime to the apple tree out back. Last year it kept coming off because of the wind so I did it right this time. I even re-fitted the drain and un-clogged the debris from the rain barrel she uses for her garden. The funniest part of fixing the rain barrel is that you have to screw the nozzle back on from the inside, but I’m much to big to crawl in and do it myself, so we were laughing because my mom is 4’11 and so small that she did it without a problem. It made me happy to see her happy, because we’d never gotten around to fixing that last year. I climbed up into the rafters of the garage, this old barn that used to store carriages for the town back before cars existed; and is now part of our family property. We had all our patio furniture up there so my sister and I worked together to bring it down so we could set everything up. I cut my finger on the glass but it was t a big deal, and we made a joke of it. It just felt nice working together to make that outdoor space all nice again, to lessen the claustrophobia even if we can’t have guests over or really go anywhere because of the pandemic. The dog was just happy to be out there with us, and as a fragile thirteen year old creature with bad hips, I’m happy that she was there too. It’s so nice out here in this green area of town by the lake. We have space to breathe in a time when breathing is difficult. Dad and I grilled steak and vegetables and we all sat down for a big dinner on our freshly cleaned patio, now with Christmas lights strung up around the rim again. Everyone was so full afterwards that we all went to bed when the dishes were done. I think my favorite thing was my mom thanking me for making the day so nice, and for helping her with all that stuff. Now I’m here in bed, and I’m glad that outdoor space she loves so much is all nice again for the warm weather. I love my mom, and I feel so lucky to have her. I hope your moms are all doing well too. Happy Mother’s Day /lit/.\n",

            "Has anyone ever imagined the end of the world as a death-spiral into collective and self-reinforcing depression? I suppose Im kind of plagiarizing Nietzsches last-man here, but, his description of the last man is a bit antiquated here. One of the most obvious manifestations of depression is low fertility. Depression is characterized by sexual dysfunction for one, and has a self-reinforcing effect of &quot;Im sad so I have low libido, so I have no sex, and having no sex makes me even sadder.&quot; Further, depression and the suffering it entails often leads to the choice to not have children in the form of &quot;I suffer in life, why would I want to bring someone new into the world for the same?&quot; Globally, this has a kind of runaway effect. People feel depressed, they have less children, the world becomes an older, sadder, duller, less vital place, where the working population has to do more and more to support an old and retired. That, or the old can simply no longer retire, and thus life takes on the character of a condemnation to eternal work. Many elderly will likely simply choose to take their own lives in such a world. All of these processes self-reinforce, all of them make life sadder and sadder. I know that betting the entire world on one point of failure (fertility and depression) is asinine, but, it seems like there are so many factors that are only increasing our loneliness, decreasing romance, increasing sexlessness, increasing atomization. This graph was the germ for this thought. Every method that people meet sexual partners is rapidly nosediving, not even flattening to some asymptote, just careening straight down to zero. If the interpretation to this graph is true, almost 75% of people meet their sex partners online. But isnt online dating just a fucking wasteland? No one likes it. Average people get almost no interaction which is insanely depressing. Attractive women get fucking flooded with horrendous messages, and all quickly come to hate pretty much every man that even dares say &quot;hi.&quot; Every conversation on there is so fucking boring, there is never, ever a spark. Most people, including myself from time to time, just do it to receive a bit of attention and validation. Isnt our world quickly turning into a sexual wasteland? 1st world fertility rates are already in the 1.4s, which is already lower than replacement. What happens when it starts to crash even harder? What outside force will counteract this?\n",

            "I realized why BAM is so popular and whats in our future from talking to my Greek friend while on shrooms. We were talking about languages and he was saying he liked Mexican Spanish more than Iberian Spanish because of the energy and how it mixes native words into it. It made me realize how Greek is a very concrete language (something he verified) and how there arent alot of things such as prepositions, etc. The Greek language is something that arose out of the ruins of the Bronze Age collapse, when the intricate trade system collapsed and the board was reshuffled, so to speak.This Bronze Age thinking, or the emphasis on the concrete and real, is what will eventually free us from the Globohomo. We live in a time of mass illusion, where everything is inflated and distorted (I felt this on an almost metaphysical level while surfing the internet while on the trip). Everything is rife with uncertainty and doubt. See the stock market and the unemployment rate.Bronze Age thinking is an antidote to the Globohomo because it is all about what is real, and concrete. The Late Bronze Age, with its intricate systems and relative peace, probably had a lot of similarities to today. When the top heavy system of records fell apart, what was left was the real.The Greeks emerged as something concrete from the chaos. They were truly an Apollonian force out of a Dionysian era. So too will this new age emerge as something real. We will see which ideas will be tested and what will emerge.\n",

            "These changes are mostly the product of the collapse of the feminine domain, which resulted in increasing alienation. Many people blame technology. But people are social creatures and much prefer company. Technology is just a cope. It use to be the case that women ruled the &quot;social&quot; dimension of life and men the &quot;business&quot; side of it. Read Jane Austen or Edith Wharton and you get a clear sense of how women kept society together in much the same way that women keep the family together. Dinner parties, events, invitations, etc. Because they were not involved in business they had more time and energy to devote to keeping society connected. Men and women had more chances for face to face meetings, learning about each other, forming meaningful longterm bonds, etc. Now it almost has to be done through tech or drunk at a bar or at work because those provide sufficient justification or courage to make connections that might otherwise have been made with much greater ease and comfort in a society like Austens or Whartons. Its insane to me that women have traded doing something that they are not only good at but love doing in order to be &quot;strong independent women&quot; (basically spend all day writing law briefs, filling prescriptions, fixing accounts, drawing up a marketing plan, etc). Funny that women in those novels never seem anything but blissfuly content with their position in society compared to the constant miserable nagging you see today.\n",

Its going to be a shitshow unless sexual monogamy in addition to relationship monogamy are enforced.The present effects will nevertheless be a generation of men who grow up losing their virginities in their late 20s to the girl who will eventually marry them. She will be sexually unsatisfied with her match because she has been pleasured repeatedly in her prime by men who are significantly more sexually attractive. The combined dissatisfaction in those relationships as well as the discontent of young men who are unable to be sexually active will quite literally destroy society as their desires sublimate violentlyGiven that I am one of the few young male victors who has regular sex with cute girls from dating apps I find it more amusing than concerning though I nonetheless think incels will emerge as a cultural tour de force in coming years\n",
            "Good post despite the humblebrag. A critical mass of losers with no prospects in life is a political powder keg. On this issue, I think this quote of Dalrymples is useful. In my study of communist societies, I came to the conclusion that the purpose of communist propaganda was not to persuade or convince, not to inform, but to humiliate; and therefore, the less it corresponded to reality the better. When people are forced to remain silent when they are being told the most obvious lies, or even worse when they are forced to repeat the lies themselves, they lose once and for all their sense of probity. To assent to obvious lies is...in some small way to become evil oneself. Ones standing to resist anything is thus eroded, and even destroyed. A society of emasculated liars is easy to control. I think if you examine political correctness, it has the same effect and is intended to.There is only so far you can sink the claws of social engineering and control into people, only so much you can take away from them and humiliate them and feed them bullshit and commodify them on scaled up sexual and employment marketplaces until they will stop participating and start finding ways to fight back and claim what they feel has been taken from them.

            "These films were not simply “tensely romantic.” Fanck’s pop-Wagnerian vehiclesfor Riefenstahl were no doubt thought of as apolitical when they were made but theycan also be seen in retrospect, as Siegfried Kracauer has argued, as an anthology ofproto-Nazi sentiments. The mountain climbing in Fanck’s pictures was a visuallyirresistible metaphor of unlimited aspiration toward the high mystic goal, bothbeautiful and terrifying, which was later to become concrete in Führerworship. Thecharacter that Riefenstahl generally played was that of a wild girl who dares to scalethe peak that others, the “valley pigs,” shrink from. Her first role, in the silent TheHoly Mountain (1926), is that of a young dancer named Diotima being wooed by anardent climber who converts her to the healthy ecstasies of Alpinism. This characterunderwent a progressive aggrandizement. In her first talkie, Avalanche (1930),Riefenstahl is a mountain-possessed girl in love with a young meteorologist, whosaves him when he is stranded on his storm-wrecked observatory on the peak ofMont Blanc.Riefenstahl herself directed six feature films. Her first, which was released in 1932,was another mountain film—The Blue Light (Das Blaue Licht). Riefenstahl starredin it as well, playing a role similar to the ones in Fanck’s films for which she hadbeen “so widely admired, not least by Adolf Hitler,” but allegorizing the dark themesof longing, purity, and death that Fanck had treated rather scoutishly.The role Riefenstahl devised for herself is of “Junta,” a primitive creature who has aunique relation to a destructive power. (Only Junta, a ragclad outcast girl of thevillage, is able to reach the blue light safely.) She is brought to her death, not by theimpossibility of the goal symbolized by the mountain but by the materialist, prosaicspirit of envious villagers and the blind rationalism of a well-meaning visitor from thecity. (Junta knows that the blue light is emitted by precious stones; being a creatureof pure spirit, she revels in the jewels’ beauty, indifferent to their material value. Butshe falls in love with a vacationing painter and naively confides in him the secret. Hetells the villagers, who scale the mountain, remove the treasure, and sell it; when Juntastarts her ascent at the next full moon, the blue light is no longer there to guide her,and she falls and dies.)\n",

Of course there are some children who are mentally precocious and therefore able to consent informedly, but these are in the minority and impossible to detect with some sort of standardised test, therefore it is better to just outlaw all pedophilia.15323685Pedophilia was practiced for thousands of years. It is likely that girls in the Bronze Age would be married off and impregnated when they reached the physical threshold for child-bearing.\n",
            "One problem with pedophilia, meaning an exclusive attraction to prepubescent children, is that its unsustainable and not conducive to promoting the social order. Take, for instance, two men, both of whom have married a girl who is nine years old, but only one of whom is a pedophile. The normal man will be able to maintain his relationship with his wife, though that relationship will change over time, because, in the absence of a serious accident, she will never permanently develop into something that will be completely incapable of satiating his physical needs and will, again assuming that she is physically healthy, be perfectly capable of bearing and raising children. There will be problems caused in part by the natural progression of male and female desire, but these problems will be surmountable, by willpower if by nothing else.The pedophile will not be able to do such a thing, because his attraction is exclusively for prepubescents. His wife will eventually permanently develop into a being for which he can feel neither love nor attraction. His desires will be left completely unsated, and he will feel compelled to predate on either his own children or those of others. Regardless of what decision he makes at that point, he will end up on an endless treadmill, because no prepubescent will be able to satisfy him for more than a limited period of time. The former situation is a positive good and carries little chance for serious harm to the social order. Even if the normal man finds strict monogamy impossible, prostitution exists as a limited and regulated outlet that consumes a small and finite number of women. The damage can be kept limited. The damage dealt by the latter situation, however, is limited only by the size of the pedophile population. Such men are little interested in householding, except as a convenient cover for their activities, and can and will gobble up, ruin, and destroy as many children as they are allowed to. And, as we all know, children who have been so despoiled have serious problems functioning normally later in life. They often become sexual deviants. The greater the population of sexual deviants, the greater the burden on society as a whole and the smaller the pool of healthy mates available for selection by men and women... and so on and so forth.Essentially, pedophiles undermine the sexual order, and are downright parasitic in that they prey on children while having little interest in producing any of their own. Their desires are not only unnatural, but cannot be channeled in any positive direction. The best we can hope to do without killing them is confine them to viewing cartoon drawings on Norwegian underwater basketweaving forums like this.On the other hand, there is no positive argument for accepting pedophiles other than &quot;BUT IT DOESNT AFFECT YOU,&quot; &quot;LOVE IS LOVE,&quot; &quot;IF THEY WANNA FUCK KIDS, WHOS TO SAY THEY CANT?&quot; and other forms of liberal sophistry.

Plato even derides other states for their involvement of sexuality in political life saying that they cannot pin down a stable constitution because of it as well as other material excesses.I dont say its natural, certainly other human societies have mixed these things, but they havent been our societies. People wanting to fuck children may be part of humanity, but its incompatible with human society as we have it today.15325721because there are always power-imbalances, however small.Some are not meaningful, or are arguably non-existent.

RATHER THAN DEVELOPING PROCEDURES TO ASSESS MENS REA IN CHILDREN, LEGISLATURES (VIA STATUTORY LAW) AND JUDGES (VIA CASE LAW) HAVE ATTEMPTED TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEMS BY DEVELOPING LEGAL PROTECTIONS FOR JUVENILES. THE PREVAILING RULE IS THAT ALL CHILDREN UNDER AGE 7 ARE INCAPABLE OF COMMITTING A CRIME BECAUSE THEY CANNOT FORMULATE THE APPROPRIATE MENS REA (UNDERSTANDING OF THE REASONABLE AND PROBABLE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR ACTIONS). FOR PERSONS BETWEEN THE AGES OF 7 AND 14, THE PRESUMPTION OF NO MENS REA IS REBUTTABLE. PERSONS 14 YEARS AND OLDER ARE TREATED AS ADULTS WITH REGARD TO MENS REA. A REVIEW OF HISTORY, STATUTES, AND CASE LAW PERTAINING TO JUVENILE MENS REA SUGGESTS THAT THE KEY ELEMENT UNDERLYING A COURTS INQUIRY INTO MENS REA IS THE CHILDS INTENT TO COMMIT THE ACT. THE STUDY OF INTENTIONALITY AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN CHILDREN IS NOT NEW TO PSYCHOLOGY. A REVIEW OF PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH INTO THE AGES AT WHICH CHILDREN DISTINGUISH BETWEEN ACCIDENTAL AND INTENTIONAL ACTS AND BEGIN TO SHOW GREATER CONCERN FOR INTENT THAN FOR CONSEQUENCES PROVIDES NO SUPPORT FOR THE IRREBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION OF NO MENS REA IN CHILDREN UNDER 7 YEARS OF AGE. RESEARCH FINDINGS INDICATE THAT THE LOWER AGE LIMIT FOR IRREBUTABLE PRESUMPTION OF NO MENS REA SHOULD BE ABOLISHED OR LOWERED TO AGE 4. THE PREVAILING RULES TWO OTHER AGE DIVISIONS DO CONFORM TO THE RESULTS OF MORAL DEVELOPMENT STUDIES IN CHILDREN. A TEST FOR ASSESSING MENS REA IN CHILDREN CLEARLY IS NEEDED.

Criminal law concerning the community whose law is transgressed rather than the plaintiffs inspiration to continue the trial.1.1 If we consider sex with a child within a community that forbids it, consensual sex acts as a precedent for further indecent acts which could lead to the degeneration of the wronged community.1.2 In event of a crime, a wrong has to be set straigjt damned it be if the defendant were a child. The community is wronged and demands blood.2. The hedonistic calculus weighs more heavily in event of crime than in event of pedophillic sex. The long term detriment from the irresponsible decision of a child to copulate with an adult is enough to raise the age of consent whereas the result of a crime serves as reason for the opposite, where more people are hurt and as such the balance has to be levelled out. That said, consistency is important and 14 isnt that impressionable an age.\n",

Any input is welcomeThe “non-free will” is mythology; in real life it is only a question of STRONG and WEAK wills. — It is almost always a symptom of what is lacking in himself, when a thinker, in every “causal-connection” and “psychological necessity,” manifests something of compulsion, indigence, obsequiousness, oppression, and non-freedom; it is suspicious to have such feelings — the person betrays himself.\n",
            "Very loosely he means: you are never forced to do something. The will is always free, it can never be compelled. People who make justifications like &quot;oh I had to&quot;, &quot;I had no other choice&quot; or &quot;I couldnt resist&quot; are not subject to anything expect their own whimsy and compulsions. Their wills are not slaves, simply weak.\n",
            "There are no facts, only interpretations, and the prevailing interpretation at a given time is an indication of whether the will of the interpreter is strong or weak. Nietzsche is conflating fatalism with weakness there; its the projection of a will that feels no other option than to submit.\n",

You may find it in one of these; you may instead find it in your family, or your community. Simply try and cultivate the drive to give your suffering up to some greater cause, so that others may be delivered from the pain youve experienced.

All my life I have felt unneeded, unwanted, pathetic, inferior, weird, creepy, childlike, and after gaining a humanities degree and failing to find work I compensated for these feelings by essentially trying myself to the mast of a company I make efforts not to be associated with (online, etc). Havent taken more than a day of annual leave since January last year, and really I guess Im just hoping Ill burn myself out to the point where I have no choice but to quit. But that doesnt seem likely so Im just trying to repress as much as possible, except for days like today where it all comes out and I feel dazed and frantic, wanting to escape into sleep even though I slept eleven hours last night.Im looking at people my age like a child would look at an adult; I am inexperienced, still scared of the world, prone to catastrophic thinking (i.e., if I quit this job Im fucked forever), and still acting like the repressed sycophant which Ive tended to play in order to impress figures of authority to a pathetic degree. I assume in general that I am a drain on other peoples time and so make no effort to talk to anyone IRL in a way that may lead to my forming a bond let alone a relationship. Every adult male to me seems like an unsatisfiable figure of objective authority and I dont know how to be around adult males without trying to please them even if its at my own expense. No charisma and what were left of my physical looks have now degraded, probably in part to me recent drinking habit and 5+ cigarettes a day. Im essentially a manchild, a puer aeternus, and whats worse is that I see no future for myself due to the fact that I have done things in life which have made me rather prominent at one time but which retrospectively will be viewed as me lying, which is something that has ruined my conscience to the point where all I want to do is sleep and smoke cigarettes (which I dont really enjoy doing).Repeated urges to resign from my job and disappear for a while, maybe hiking across Europe or something, but really all I need (I think) is a steady job which I am not ashamed of, pays okay, and isnt more than 9-5. I literally for whatever reason cant imagine finding a girlfriend and being content living a life without writing in the hope of publication and validation. Life without writing seems pointless, but I no longer support my ambitions to write because I am ashamed of who I am and the things I have done which are contrary to my usually quite strict ethical compass.

Basically, the most visible outcome of the West’s inability to acknowledge a hierarchy of values is that nobody knows *how to be.* I.e. because there is no objective ideal against which one, nobody can really evaluate themselves. This leaves one totally dependent on a society (which nobody really likes) for their sense of self, and since no “higher” ideals can be formed, what ends up occupying people’s minds is the pursuit of the most base expressions of raw power and domination — sex, money, clout, dissipation — even though, almost to a man, this is not what people claim to value.A further consequence is the experience by the individual of the judgement of the non-society, and it’s lack of ideals as anxiety (am I valued?) or depression (I am not valued). And there is no escape from this situation, because paradoxically, the flattening of all hierarchies has meant that there is no hierarchy of values (aside crude domination) which one can ascend. People end up making abortive attempt after abortive attempt to “improve,” but cannot because that concept has no value in a society that has reached a state of relativism as advanced as ours.\n",

In retrospective, Ive purposefully distanced myself from all those near me and was not able to present myself as a human to maintain relationships with others. Ive long lost any relationships Ive had with girls. Sexual desire has become detached from everything else and is is becoming the equivalent of hideous grotesque sore that must be treated habitually but has little chance of healing. Oddly enough, I dont desperately long for human contact at this point as Ive had in the beginning of my self forced isolation. I do everything I can to minimize going out around other humans for the last decade, moving into a sparsely populated area and bulk/online shopping. I work in front of a computer, and then continue to sit in front of one 16-18 hours a day, every day. I go running sometimes but when I return, I have a rush of energy that turns into a severe down state. I read a lot on many subjects but find myself removed and detached from the majority. I have lost interest in consumption, film, and video games over the years. I have money and have been keeping myself busy investing and maintaining a decent income/skillset.

Its that they ask why and you explain why and they score your explanation for relative importance implied upon the subject of the why and move on. The resulting sorted list is then, sorted and sorted and sorted again, what you misinterpret as &quot;knowledge&quot;, but in point of fact until they start doing things on their own they know nothing.

This is nothing else than complex systems that are not at all alternatives to order as such, but are just an extravagant, baroque (here, too, the ideas of postmodernist G. Deleuze from his essay “The Fold: Leibnitz and the Baroque” are valuable) version of a complexified, twisted and significantly perverted order. That was is today called “chaos” by representatives of the scientific and, in part, the cultural establishment is the condition of the post-logical world, a world that is still located, however, within the Logos, inside its orbit, albeit at the most distant periphery, at its last border. A very precise name for such a state of affairs has been given by René Guénon, who called this situation “la confusion” (Fr. “mixing”, “tangle”, “everything getting caught in everything else”.The concept of “chaos” that is dominant in modern science does not correspond at all to the Greek chaos as something primordial, organic, and spontaneous, but as the product of the collapse of logocentric philosophy and the logocentric culture that was based on it. The fact that we are today dealing with an alleged “chaos” actually refers to the product of the Logos’s collapse and separation into different fragments. It is precisely for this reason that scholars of “chaos” find within it residual or extravagant, eccentric structures of the Logos.Actually, it is not the Greek chaos at all that is hinted at in this concept of “chaos”, but a product of the dispersion and disintegration of the Logos. This is so because we have not yet left the bounds of the Logos: the chaos that modern science deals with is integrated into the Logos, it splashes around within its inner space (albeit at the most extreme orbit), as far away as possible from the logocentric axis, in the furthest borderland of the conceptual Platonic cosmos, in the world of the TitansThe simulacrum is not chaos, but in fact an intralogical zone. Chaos precedes order. Chaos precedes the cosmos. Post-order is just a dissipating order, not an alternative to order. Humanitys darkness is revealed to itself when it finally pierces the heart of Being, and this darkness is Non-Being, chaos. Chaos is the final inversion.\n",

You should never forget what the ACTUAL meanings of things being said are.

As for the example, I do not know what you mean by &quot;productive measure&quot;, but I can give you real world examples where the max measure is used. I think the Olympic games are a good example, where individuals are sent to represent their countries, and say if a Jamaican runner wins the 100m gold, the entire country has (whether they should is a different question) some claim to being superior sprinters. I am sure there are more such examples, but the only other ones I can think of are in software engineering, and might bore you.Also I would not be surprised if the concept of &quot;the average&quot; was not even properly invented in Aristotels time (although it seems quite relevant in agriculture, so who knows). Also, the average method of comparing collections is by no means the &quot;best&quot; method in general, even though in many cases it might be preferable to the max method. In a lot of situations you might want to weigh different elements of the collection differently for example. A communist might argue for example, that even though the average wealth in country A is grater than the average wealth in country B, if the wealth distribution in country B is flatter than that in country A, country B is in some way &quot;wealthier&quot;.\n",

He then takes those and reasons about them.Suppose we have imps of class A, who only claw, and imps of class B, who claw and throw fireballs. We know that class B is greater than class A specifically because we have seen that the greatest imp of class B claws and throws, but the greatest imp of class A only claws. Vice versa, the behavior of most exemplary specimen is what defines their respective classes. If we find out that imps of class A can also throw fireballs, then we have to alter out system of classes. In fact, thats what has been happening in biology since the times of Aristotle himself.Aside from that, everyone believed that men are men and women are women at the time, just as everyone believed that the slave should serve the master, and not the other way round.

            "the first sentence Aristotle wrote is correct. The first half of second one is retarded.&quot;So, for instance, if the tallest man is taller than the tallest woman, then men as a class are taller than women.&quot;This is retarded. Imagine a scenario where we have 20 men and 20 women. The tallest man is 7 feet tall, the rest of the men are 5 feet tall. The tallest woman is 6 feet tall, and the rest of the women are 5.5 feet tall. In this scenario, you cannot in any way say that men as a class are taller than women, because really, all the women are taller than all the men excluding the tallest man. The second half of the second seems more correct, but still, the &quot;as a class&quot; part seems to be a linguistic weakness.&quot;If men as a class are taller than women, then the tallest man is taller than the tallest woman.&quot; What does he mean by class? Does he mean the average male height is larger than the average female height? If so, then we still cannot assume which gender is tallest based on the averages.As for the third sentence, I dont get how we can compare two classes based on the attributes of the highest performer of each class. If we are in school, and class As top student gets a 100% on every assignment, and class Bs top student gets a 95% on every assignment, how can we assume the grades or intelligence of the rest of the students in the classes?\n",

Many times he specified how he despised the figure of Juan Manuel de Rosas. I think he liked the gauchos of la Pampa in the same way he liked the suburbian malevos: just as an interesting symbol or a figure to write a story about.And about the nationalism, he comes and go about the subject, some times showing some proto-libertarian sentiments, some times showing sympathies for the authoritarian south american governments of Pinochet or the Argentinian &quot;proceso of reorganización nacional&quot;. He absolutely despised Perón, though, and according to himself, in his youth, he took distances from friends whop printed some nationalistic newspapers around the time Mussolini was in control in Italy. More likely, i think, it seems like Borges believed in the possibility of an European nationalism, but rejected the idea of an American nationalism.\n",

He later felt that whole period was kinda embarrassing for him, but still loved Martin Fierro and a few other gaucho poems.According to himself, his best short story is El Sur, which is basically a suburbanites fantasy of leaving the city, moving to the country side and living like a country man.

If there wasnt, they wouldnt believe in it.On the subject I could write quite a bit. But I personaly do feel the Left is largly paternalistic, but i dont necissarily disagree with them being so. In theory it may be a necissary step in reaching the kind of Equality and change in standing and culture they eventually want to reach, but that doesnt mean the process on the road to that goal isnt still infantalization. The means jusify the ends, but that doesnt mean the means should be seen as a good, but simply as a system. Thats my main problem, it is often seen that these messures themselves are good, when in reality, the goal is for them to be eventually redundent. However, most people ony see the means and not the ends, adn treat the means itself as an ends, making the infantalization a good rather than what it is trying to achieve.

            "Its a fair point. I will do my best if we agree to keep an open mind.The fundamental premise of your argument assumes a sort of developmental malfunction -- Africans in the United States are like big children. This implies, in some form or another, that something went wrong in the growth stage, socially or individually. Fundamentally speaking, we can err on one of two sides of the developmental idea: nurture or nature. If you believe that Africans are fundamentally handicapped by nature of their genetic makeup, then this debate is pretty much over right now, because we just devolve into saying &quot;I read this&quot; and you will say &quot;I read that&quot;, and you will say my sources are SJW bullshit and I will say your sources are modern day phrenology, and so on. This is not a useful debate to have. However, I dont believe we believe this is the case. Anyone can interrogate the cultural milieu and find outstanding African men and women in their fields. I shouldnt have to name names here, because the list of successful African authors, poets, filmmakers, intellectuals, et cetera is long and prolific. Furthermore, we can see that in the wider world outside of America, there is an uneven geography of development across African-populated areas. Some are shitholes. Some, like Botswana or Rwanda, are developing very quickly. You can go to certain wealthier cities in Africa and enjoy a standard of living comparable to many areas in the States. So again, I dont believe that we can safely categorise Africans as fitting one or the other genetic category a la the racial categorisations of the 19th century. So, if we dispense of the &quot;nature&quot; conception of racial development, we are left with the &quot;nurture&quot;. Now, we both know what you speak of when you say &quot;90% of Blacks&quot;. You mean the urban poor; I dont believe youre speaking of those Africans who have become successful or wealthy. The question is then: what went wrong? Even if you dont believe in the &quot;institutional&quot; nature of racism, we can surely agree that Africans in the United States have historically had a very difficult time. The economic effects of phenomena such as slavery and discrimination are extremely long-lasting and intergenerational; the economic literature on this is quite extensive. We must then ask: if there is a &quot;problem&quot; here (Africans being &quot;big babies&quot;, as you say), how can it be fixed?\n",
            "Ideologically, you bring up the meritocracy. Now fundamentally, I dont really believe in the meritocracy as it is exercised in modern capitalism because it blinds itself to all the invisible advantages inherent in social life. Lets say my dad knows the CEO and I get a job because of it: unfair, right? You would say that is un-meritocratic. Lets say my dad is rich, makes a big donation to Harvard, and then I get a job because of that. Shakier ground, but we can still see the inherent privilege, no? You might protest, but wait, the meritocracy says that I have the better degree. Sorry. I also have the better high school, and better grades because my mum wasnt a crack addict, and so on and so on. Privilege is a meme but its also something to be taken seriously, and the modern meritocracy is a joke that serves a thin veil to keep the upper echelons of society insulated from the rest of us. Now, Im not arguing that Africans in America are the only ones who are disadvantaged. There are millions of whites with the same situation. Nevertheless, the severity and geographic concentration of such African-specific disadvantage is so great that it does tend to have reinforcing and cyclical effects. This is why you have entire communities who, as you say, couldnt survive without government welfare. But, the same phenomenon exists in certain white communities, you might say, and you are right. But your view: that whites are fine and that Africans need to be babied, neither acknowledges the historical economic processes that destroyed African communities nor acknowledges the fact that there are whites living those same realities. The real story here is that the POC/White debate is a fallacy; its a red herring to distract you from the real forces at work. Both the right and the left are guilty of this. You are right to say that much of the contemporary left is obsessed with paternalist attitudes: this is because by casting the narrative as race-based, they can skew the discussion away from class. But the right engages in the exact same dialogue by doing what youre doing and casting all Africans as uniquely handicapped. What is needed is a recognition of the realities of how race and class interact, and how economic forces above all else direct the discourse.\n",

White supremacy still exists of course and does disenfranchise non-whites via segregation, zoning, school, policies, attitudinal discrimination etc. However capitalism has grown much more progressive and is more than happy to exploit everyone.Sakais second point about setllerism being the fundamental contradiction that needs to be resolved is more fraught.

IMO I think once a culture is developed there is aethetic value in letting the culture of that land keep it. So, imo Both the white settlers and the natives have some sort of indigenous status in terms of historical legitamacy. However, in praxis, how one group should have more a claim to another when right of conquest is no longer a mainstay supported system should be down to prestige, the idea of the nation state currently extinent with a stable history and population. the problem is, when a relitively new cultural group arrives, if they are allowed to stay to long, it becomes retroactively immoral to displace them. So I think its a good idea to stop a new group from starting to begin with in the present as it will only cause strife. ANd this is why protection of extinent nation-states is important.\n",

            "So there was this amazing Junger thread here last month where this anon came in and gave an impromptu shitpost lecture concerning Junger, and even tipped his hat to the Arcades Project.

I still havent gotten to A Dangerous Encounter yet as Ive been working on some things.15324685I just mentioned in passing that a leftist could not write anything like the Arcades Project in our time. Some of the reasons for this are obvious, and a void of dominion begins to appear when we investigate the places in which we live. A similar problem faces the old leftism as it does the primitivists, the remarks of Vaneigem or Camatte would be impossible today as they approach fascism or at least an open discussion of the metaphysical aspects of their worldview. For instance, in that the bare technical destruction of liberalism is an even worse form of violence than what the fascists were accused of. There is perhaps something like the Liberal Personality that causes the thinking of the Frankfurt School or the theory of deterritorialisation: dialectical materialism enters into substance theory and is deterritorialised itself. A mass abstraction which causes marxist thinkers to follow the same territory as liberalism, this is necessary to relieve themselves of their part in the brutal order of being. The schizophrenic organisation defends its opposition through the ego. Although I dont intend this literally, it is the wrong way of understanding the world.At a deeper level, one could say that a detailed analysis of our situation, even an analysis limited to the material world, would reveal too much. This is related to the turn away from pure materialism, where the left relies on something like a corrupt theology or mysticism. Then there is the problem of maintaining influence and the mass of the organisation - the ideology must keep pace with cultural ambivalence towards the real brutality beneath the surface. Technical organisation acts like the abutment of a dam, the more bodies that are to be pulled in to the organisation requires greater counteracting forces to be built into each side of the river. This explains the seeming impossibility of radical politics. Otherwise, the absolute violence that rules over us is almost completely immaterial, or at least devastates our being at a deeper level than material destruction - may even cause to follow as a form of erosion. Materialist dialectics can never reconcile with this problem, and so its adherents, both on the left and right, must attempt to conform the invisible forces to material laws in order to maintain their organisational will. It is similar to Kantianism, occasionalism, and the political form of romanticism.\n",

            "This is an interesting general thought, though I have some particular problems about applying it to the birth of the Arcades, which I think cant be replicated due primarily due to the massive transitions that European cities and capitalism were seeing at the time. Mass consumer culture was finally emerging en masse, particularly in Weimar, which led Benjamin in part to his notions of commodities and their potential inward nature. There are various other things like this that make up Benjamins eccentricities that make up the Arcades: social democracy, his fixation on Baudelaire, Proust, France, Flaneur, historiography, an unique view of Marxism, Nietzsche, Psychoanalysis, etc. It cant be replicated because its not something that could ever be replicated, its just too unique, personal, not to mentioned unfinished.15329966Frankly I dont think anyone not versed in Benjamin would get very much out of a casual reading. Assuming youve already read &quot;The Work of Art in the age of mechanical Reproducibility&quot;, pick up the recently collected &quot;Writer of modern Life&quot; Baudelaire essays of his compiled by Michael Jennings (be sure youve read &quot;The Flowers of Evil&quot; by Baudelaire beforehand). Then Id suggest reading &quot;The Storyteller&quot; (NYRB just put out a good collection of it and related essays), then &quot;One Way Street&quot;*, which is in a way a kind of prototype for the Arcades. Lastly Id make sure to read &quot;Edward Fuchs: Historian and Collector&quot;, before finally tackling his &quot;Theses on the Philosophy of History&quot;, then dig into the Arcades. Read Jennings essay at the back of the Arcades on approaches to reading/navigating.It sounds like a lot of work, but there is hardly a writer as thoroughly engaging and fulfilling as Benjamin. He will change how you think critically, guaranteed.Suggested (but not essential) background knowledge before digging in:ProustNietzscheKierkegaards &quot;Repetition&quot;Some basic FreudHeavily recommended background:Lukacs &quot;History and Class Consciousness&quot;Marx, particularly Commodity Fetishism (though you should know this already) and the 18th BrumaireBaudelaires Flowers of Evil and the &quot;Painter of Modern Life&quot;*Do not get the compilation of &quot;One Way Street and Other Essays&quot;, as its only fragments of OWS, whereas the newer edition has the left out and early versions as well as Jennings excellent introduction.\n",
            "bumping this, link thread retard\n",
            "Last note:Id also recommend reading the introduction to Benjamins &quot;Berlin Childhood Around 1900&quot;, which is this essay by Peter Szondi called &quot;Hope in The Past&quot;, which cleared up a lot of Benjamins positions on history/memory, as well as places his work in a larger historical/philosophical context, as well as talks about his strangely oblique influence on later theorists (particularly the situationists). Definitely worth a read.And all English versions of the Arcades are exactly the same. It was translated in the 90s and thats the only one we have.

            "To clarify, since my first paragraph had a number of holes in it, I wasnt really speaking to Benjamins intentions or the situation surrounding his project. My concern was basically a relation of the left and right to intellectual projects.I dont know that it was really unique, there are many similar efforts throughout history, Pseudo-Apollodorus and the Encyclopedia of the Gods, for example. Not that I think being unique is all that important.Someone who lacks confidence in their own writing could do something like this today, lets say for a region or even the whole of Europe. Collecting general quotes on the migrant crisis, political shifts, small-scale wars, economic decay, etc. may be quite useful within the general intellectual decline. As we know there are gems scattered across the internet, often by anonymous posters here, and in short articles, videos, etc. These could be compiled and sorted in a similar way to the Arcades Project, or lets say a right-wing/third positionist wikipedia that is much more focused on its intent.There is something similar to the oral language in our time. There is a potential in this that academia has no access to, and compiling an image of our time through an encyclopedia would give character to this. It may even allow some of the lost voices and identities return to focus, enable them a sense of power, at least for the future.\n",
            "hearsay\n",
            "I mean what makes Benjamins work unique is that its attempting to forge, as well as demonstrate through the formal character of the work itself, a conception of history and a mode of analysis that were never completed, and therefore cant be imitated. And while of course anyone can (and probably should) collect spurious notes, thoughts, and quotes to construct a kind of history or study, the other important part of the Arcades is that its form, as the literary montage, is consciously of its own time. That is, any new attempt ought to attempt to have some formal and theoretical correspondence with its own particular time and place, if you want to really follow what Benjamin was trying to get at.\n",

I remember trying to read a book of his when i was around 14-17 years old, because I suffered from severe clinical depression and tried to get back into reading. Recommended by a long gone friend. It was a story about Death retireing and then zombies just appeared, or something. I got bored really quickly and while some parts were interesting, most of the other stuff was annoyingly to read. I dropped the book and forgot about the author. Anyways, I shared my experiences with my friend and she basically turned the friendly discussion into a heated argument, because Pratchett is great social commentary, satire and absoluletly hilarious. Turns out a lot of people i know seem to adore this man (or his books, that wasnt clear) and I felt like a literature outcast, getting called a humorless asshole and things like that. Just because i dont worship a certain author. Well, i gave them the benefit of the doubt and started reading &quot;The Colour of magic&quot;. Halfway through, it seems like a wholesome, easy read to relax with funny ideas and names, weirdly written cuts between scenes and generic fantasy elements with some twists in it. Meanwhile I looked up Pratchetts reception on the internet and it seems to me at last, that there are rarely if none negative views on his works, just &quot;Its the best, period&quot; without any explanation and if negative views come to light, the pitchforks and torches come out and the hunt begins.So in short, how did that happen? Is this the case of &quot;Read 20 books then you get it&quot;-kind of thing, or do i miss something? I just want some civil opinions, or something similar.\n",

Hes not aiming to write an epic or to give you a sniff of his farts; its just a turtle hurtling through space and the people on it go on adventures.I think the fans are so insufferable because defend him as they would defend a friend.

That said his &quot;social commentary&quot; is weak beyond a few quips that edge on the nerves of modern politics (like questioning the notion that being a minority/poor/etc doesnt mean youre automagically a good person) and his humour can sometimes get way too into &quot;wink wink nudge nudge we both know what I mean roight?&quot; territory with how self-satisfied it can get.

Pratchett took those same ingredients and layered them with humor and self-reference and some genuine thematic coherency and his audience ate it up because it felt different enough without actually being too complex or challenging to lose that basic genre appeal. Theres an old rule of marketing that says you should try to give the customer more than they expect but less than what would overwhelm them, and intentionally or not Pratchett used that rule really well.\n",

She never recognized this (in the introduction for &quot;the new intellectual&quot; she actually spends a few words specifically criticizing Nitzsche and his work), but when you read Atlas Shrugged its painfully obvious that she intends for John Galt to be his own version of Jesus Christ (without the final sacrifice for human kind, for that would be contradictory with her own set of morals; he only lives for himself and what he values).Now, when i say &quot;tried&quot; its because she failed miserably. You cant have an objective set of ethics without transcendent metaphysics principles to give nourishment to the rest of the system. Despite criticizing him so much, she failed in the same sense as Kant: she rationalized ethics. She tried to create an autonomous and secular morality, her own categorical imperative. All her system of ethics is sustained by a mere commandment that, at the moment one tries to give it a concrete justification, it falls. All the rational ethical imperatives of the philosophies of modernity have this problem, it is not exclusive to Rand; the lack of metaphysics necessarily implies the presumed axiomatic value of unexplained premises, which in the long run are linked to either a personal equation or to the factual and accepted structure from a certain society.\n",

            "Lacan is garbage.By that I dont mean I disagree with his ideas, I mean he was a terrible, authoritarian person who didnt believe in his own rhetoric. He was a manipulative charlatan, and his work appeals only to other manipulative charlatans. Lacans ideas and writing are not conceptually coherent. That means anyone drawing on Lacan is not astute or critical enough to recognize and avoid incoherent, inferentially defunct ideas. Is that who you want to be influenced by?Lacan was a master of the straw man approach. He says shit like &quot;Freud assures us that X; our experience of the unconscious proves that Y.&quot; Except if you look carefully, quite often Freud doesnt say anything of the sort anywhere, Lacan just needs a foil for his own nonsense.There are two problems with this. The first is, its a dishonest gesture, an argument in bad faith. But worse, straw men get picked up. Someone who only reads Lacan and doesnt know Freud walks away from Lacans text convinced Freud says X when he doesnt. Theyll repeat it as a fact at cocktail mixers and teach it to their students without ever tracking down the actual Freud passages.Only fundamentally awful people find Lacan charming or appealing. I honesty cant think of a more reliable indicator of intellectual bad faith than Lacanianism. I mean, Heidegger was a Nazi but at least he was actually trained as a philosopher.He loved to pepper his conferences and books with misused references to mathematical concepts or various scientific theories. He was the typical &quot;big talk guy&quot;, always using complicated words to cloud his own misunderstanding or give some shade of scientific authority to his fantasies. By the way &quot;big wordism&quot; is a generalized fault among social scientists and philosophers (Deleuze and Guattari are particularly incomprehensible at times) however Lacan is in a class of his own by his propension to bullshit.Lacan is not Freud. Lacan is a chimeric mixture of Kojeve, Heidegger, Hegel, Saussure, Bataille, Jaspers, and even Salvador Dali. Lacan was a Hegelian demagogue who did not actually read or care about Freud. If you want to learn/read/teach Freud, forget Lacan, forget Lacanians. Lacans charlatanry would never have been possible if there had been a French standard edition of Freud in the 50s and 60s, because anyone would have been able to see that the texts dont actually say what he claimed they said.Psychoanalysis is an empirics of intensities, it is not a hermeneutics. The analyst is not a detective, and neurosis has very little to do with truth. If youre reading a book and the author tells you psychoanalysis is an allegory of reading, put down the book.\n",
            "At the distance of 35 some-odd years I give Lacan an armchair diagnosis as a pathological narcissist, who in another time and place might have been a Jim Jones or Da Free John, but instead found his narcissistic outlet first as a psychotherapist and then as a public intellectual. His speech style is so affected and self-consciously performative. I strongly he suspect he picked up his public speaking skill from Alexandre Kojève, who held seminars that Lacan attended as a young man and were by all accounts electrifying.Its mostly just my opinion, but its an opinion I have based on reading his entire lecture series, a lot of his other writings, and his biography, as well as watching Lacan Parle and Psychanalyse 1 and 2 (both are available for free on the internet if you search hard enough; theres also a documentary called Quartier Lacan containing interviews with his contemporaries about his work and his life.)Im not being combative or demeaning when I say that I think he was a charlatan, but he was what he was, and it becomes pretty apparent when you dive into his work, watch the few taped appearances that exist, and read about how he treated his patients as well as his relationship with the psychoanalytic society.In one of Zizeks documentaries (cant remember if it was Pervs Guide to Cinema or Pervs Guide to Ideology) theres a segment where Zizek is sitting on a couch in his home watching Lacan Parle and he makes a pretty interesting analysis about Lacan, double interesting because the same analysis could apply to Zizek himself. I honestly think the reason he gives is why Zizek is so enamored with him, and it makes sense when youve read enough of him and seen him speak in public.For what its worth, nothing im saying isnt common knowledge, even Zizek said something along the lines of: Lacan is a largely charlatan (a lot of lacanian psychoanalysts think hes largely bullshit as well), and he does not care for Lacans presentation and theatrics but he believes that Lacan was on to something nevertheless.http://www.psychiatrie-und-ethik.de/infc/en/Shrink_from_Hell.htm\n",
            "Lol!\n",
            "Lacan was born in 1901 into a wealthy middle-class family and trained as a doctor. He was attracted first to neurology but soon abandoned this because the patients troubles were too &quot;routine&quot;, as his biographer (who clearly sympathises with his inhumanity) explains. If Elizabeth Roudinescos account is accurate, he must have made a hash of his first case presentation to the Societe Neurologique: his patient, she says, supposedly had &quot;pseudobulbar disorders of the spinal cord&quot; - a neurological impossibility. (The innocence with which Roudinesco reports all kinds of clinical cock-ups makes this book a particularly disturbing read for a medic.) Abandoning neurology was obviously a wise career move. Unfortunately, though he lacked all the qualities necessary to make a half-way decent doctor (eg kindness, common sense, humility, clinical acumen and solid knowledge), Lacan did not abandon medicine altogether, only its scientific basis. He chose to be a psychoanalyst where, instead of elucidating diagnoses, he could impose them.He fastened on Marguerite Pantaine, a tragically deluded woman who had attempted to kill a well-known actress. For a year, he and Marguerite were, according to Roudinesco, &quot;inseparable&quot;. (She had no choice, being in detention.) The elaborate story he concocted about her became the basis of an entire theory of the sick soul and formed his doctoral thesis. In the great tradition of psychoanalysis, &quot;he listened&quot;, Roudinesco says, &quot;to no truths other than those which confirmed his own hypotheses&quot;. More precisely, the truth was that which confirmed his hypothesis: into her case, &quot;he projected not only his own theories on madness in women but also his own fantasies and family obsessions&quot;. For this soul-rape Lacan was awarded his doctorate and his reputation was made. To the end of her days, Marguerite remained bitterly resentful of the use he had made of her. With good reason: Lacans crackpot theories, partly expropriated from Salvador Dali, probably prolonged her incarceration. To add insult to injury, he &quot;borrowed&quot; all her writings and photographs and refused to give any of them back.Lacanians may argue that the great edifice of the Ecrits is not undermined by revelations about his life: the Masters thoughts should be judged on their own merits. However, in the absence of any logical basis or empirical evidence, the authority of the thought has derived almost completely from the authority of the man. The discovery that Lacan was the shrink from hell is not, therefore, irrelevant. Roudinescos biography is consequently an act of liberation on behalf of those students, forced by uncritical teachers who do not know Stork from butter, to try to understand and make sense of his nonsense. This act of liberation is all the more compelling for being the work of a disciple and thus in part involuntary.\n",

How about you understand what he means? Various conceptions of elements exist too, look at Indian and Chinese ones for some different takes intertwined with their philosophy/religion. Pro tip: they are more fundamental than your thinking and not limited to some discipline or material reality. The concept of states of matter is uncritically copy-pasted from classical elements too, though much more limited in scope obviously. Earth (solid), Water (liquid), Air (gas), fire (plasma). Understand that ancient people used words in highly abstract ways that simply translating them doesnt capture. The abstract words we have today, though mostly now specialised, came about in the same way. Do you know what he means by heavier and lighter?

If its a float, dont convert it to an int and store both on the object, just analyze the float when you want to use it for whatever it is you want to do. Using multiple ifs here doesnt make sense either since its sole purpose is around conversion. Instead he should be using the value as it is, in the context where the value needs to be checked.For example, if youre going to perform some grotesque action like &quot;hold hands&quot; youd probably want to sayif affection &lt; 100 {    abstainFrom(mainChar);} else {    lewdAction(mainChar);}Its hard to say how to improve it without the context, but the data translation itself is highly questionable no matter what.Even if you wanted to do this though you could just directly assign in one statement by just dividing the value by a constant divisor.result = input / 25The only edge case is if your language doesnt handle left hand 0 division, and youd need to assure the value is 125 for 5, or fall through. In the worst case it would still look like this.int result = 0;if input 0 {    if input  100 {        result = 5;    } else {        result = input / 25    }}\n",

So lets say some function gives you integers and depending upon where the integer lies like 0-5, 5-10, 10-20 etc, separate things happen. How to make it less ugly? The way Ive been doing it so far is to write a long ass conditional statements.

For a single lookup the cost of the cache miss along with pulling from memory is going to outweigh the cost of a properly optimized Floating Point calculation. This remains true if the the size of the table is very large and the values which you are looking up are sporadic enough to cause cache misses every time. At that point, unless you are multithreading and are fine with the lookup from main for every calculation(which has its own series of problems from context switching with a small instruction, which would cause more headaches than it will alleviate). I am not saying youre wrong about this part, but we dont know the data which we are talking about, so any firm statement about whether or not this code is good or bad is baseless without looking at the performance results of both types of code.Loops and switch statements are syntactic sugar for gotos anyways and nobody complains about thoseNot necessarily. There are many cases where loops and switch statements are syntactic sugar for gotos, they may be optimized out. Loops and switch statements have a large amount of very well documented compiler optimizations for loops and switch statements(loop unrolling, code motion, etc). Although I can personally say that there are few times when gotos are preferable to other forms of control flow. It might not have been acceptable practice in the 80s, but a large amount of compiler research and optimization has let loops and switch statements become faster control flow constructs in most cases. Even in the cases when goto is faster,  it is generally harder to maintain code quality when working with several developers.\n",

But the good ones don’t ever want to organize; the bad ones tend to organize because they lust after power. Powerful consciousnesses don’t want to dominate other people, they want to empower them, so they don’t tend to get together, until things are really late in the game. Then they come together and evil’s always defeated, because good is so much stronger. We’re on this planet and Einstein’s physics show and Max Planck’s physics’ show that there are at least 12 dimensions. And now that’s what all the top scientists and billionaires are coming out saying, ‘it’s a false hologram—it is artificial.’ The computers are scanning it and finding tension points where it’s artificially projected, and gravity’s bleeding-in to this universe. That’s what they call ‘dark matter’. There’s this sub-transmission zone below the 3rd dimension that just turned over the most horrible things—it’s what it resonates to. And it’s trying to get up into the 3rd dimension—that’s just a basic level consciousness—to launch into the next levels. And our species is already way up at the 5th/6th dimension, consciousining (sic) our best people. But there’s this big war trying to basically destroy humanity, because humanity has free will. And there’s a decision to which level we want to go to. We have free will, so evil’s allowed to come and contend, and not just good. Which is kinda like a false transmission, because what they’re thinking is that they are is ugly and bad, projecting it onto themselves, instead of believing ‘no, it’s a human test about building us up.’\n",

So all of our thoughts go into it. And we’re actually building a computer that has real neurons in real-time that’s also psychically connected to us, that are organic creatures, so that they will have current prediction powers, future prediction powers, a true crystal ball, but the big secret is: Once you have a crystal ball and know the future, you can add stimuli before-hand that make decisions that control the future, and so then it’s the end of consciousness and free will for individuals as we know, and a true 2.0 (and a very bad way) hive-mind consciousness with an AI jacked-into everyone, knowing our hopes and dreams, delivering it to us, not in some PKD wire-head system where we plug in and give up on consciousness because of unlimited pleasure, but because we were already wired-in and absorbed before we knew it by giving over our consciousness to the system, our daily decisions—that it was able to manipulate and control into a larger system. There’s now a human counter-strike taking place, to shut this off before it gets fully into place, and to block these systems and to try to have an actual debate about where humanity goes, and cut-off the pedophiles and psychic vampires that are in control of this AI system before humanity’s destroyed.\n",

So for example someone might want you to add a form to their website, you could either charge by hour or give a fixed bid. Theres pros and cons to each method. Charging by the hour means the client cant withhold payment for something they think should have been implemented if they didnt specify it before. They paid for 8 hours of work and you work on it for 8 hours. If they want more they need to purchase more hours so you can continue working on it.By setting a fixed price you might work 40 hours on something and only get paid the equivalent of like $5 an hour, so you gotta translate your fixed bid into the number of hours you think it will take you to get the price to charge. If the client wants something they think should have been included in the original estimate, they will refuse to pay you because they will claim the feature they paid you for isnt complete yet.Anyway Id start with fixed bids because then you dont need to worry about going over the hours they paid for, you just need to worry about implementing their feature for them no matter if it takes you 1 hour or 40. Once you get a hold on how long it takes you to implement things, you could switch to charging by the hour\n",

You dont know how good we used to have it.VIA used to be one of the big third party manufacturers of motherboard chipsets, compatible with x86 CPUs from Intel and AMD, Cyrix and Centaur. Actual normal desktop stuff. I used to have a Cyrix-based desktop that was comparable to its Pentium contemporary, for example, but much cheaper. The sockets were compatible until the mid 90s, diverging further apart for each company later on.Then in the late 90s they bought Cyrix and Centaur and continued to make mainstream desktop x86 CPUs. These continued to use the same sockets as competing Intel chips. Which motherboards, and again, when?What, you want me to paste the whole list here out of their wikipedia article?Basically when you scroll down the chipset page you can look at the dates and the supported CPUs; no Intel or AMD support after 2006. The CPU sub-pages are messier, but to summarize: no new cores since 2013. It matches what the main page says about the settlement.Little embedded versions of their final x86 cores are the last remains of what used to be a larger range of stuff. But you may notice from the CPU specs that their clock speeds were still competitive with Intel and AMD into the early 2000s and still used the same socket as Intel.

On these VIA C3 processors, the second hidden processor mode is accessed by executing the x86 instruction ALTINST (0F 3F). If AIS mode has been enabled, the processor will perform a JMP EAX[1] and begin executing AIS instructions at the address of the EAX register. Using AIS allows native access to the Centaur Technology-designed RISC core inside the processor.[2]In 2018 Christopher Domas discovered that some Samuel 2 processors came with the Alternate Instruction Set enabled by default and that by executing AIS instructions from user space, it was possible to gain privilege escalation from Ring 3 to Ring 0.[9] Domas had partially reverse engineered the AIS instruction set using automated fuzzing against a cluster of seven thin clients.[10] Domas used the terms &quot;deeply embedded core&quot; (DEC) plus &quot;deeply embedded instruction set&quot; (DEIS) for the RISC instruction set, &quot;launch instruction&quot; for ALTINST, &quot;bridge instruction&quot; for the x86 prefix wrapper, &quot;global configuration register&quot; for the Feature Control Register (FCR), and documented the privilege escalation with the name &quot;Rosenbridge&quot;.

Pic related is a screenshot of my NixOS laptop with fairly stock settings for font rendering. Does linux have a problem with font rendering or is it just noobs that dont know how to configure their fonts? Is Windows font rendering worth replicating or can we admit windows always had terrible font display? Has apple gone backwards and lost their position as the company that makes visually beautiful software?I think over the last decade software has gone to shit and at the same time the average computer user has become less knowledgeable about computers so they dont even know how to fix the problems themselves. Can we fix open source software to provide operating systems to end users which actually look nice enough to use every day?

So this is an aspect of linux that gets frustrating, although every OS has the problem of multiple frameworks causing inconsistent results. If you use i3 and XFCE then you need to get GTK to be consistent with plain old xlib/xft rendering, which is probably easier than for someone like me that uses firefox(gtk) on kde(qt/plasma). The nice thing about i3 is that you get pretty straight forward results from configuring XFT, whereas GTK programs have that extra layer of &quot;magic&quot; that makes it harder to get the result you want.When you ask &quot;what are you folk using?&quot; I dont really know what you are asking.

Its officially activated. only benefit of doing this is so you dont have to run hwid.kms38.gen.mk6.exe every time The reason the process only needs to be performed once is because its officially activated and the key is stored on Microsofts servers. So say you need to re-install windows 10 on the same machine for whatever reason. Microsoft know you already activated it, albeit via HWIDGEN, so you dont have to run HWIDGEN again. Should you have to re-install Windows 10, just choose that you have no product key, connect to the internet, and Microsoft will activate it (because they know you already activated it before). In the past, the method for activating Windows 7 involved a loader that loaded a fake product key before you booted your machine. This is not the case anymore.

            "That worries me because I dont want my install to get bricked or whatever in any way and lose all of my stuff.Sorry. What I meant for &quot;how long this will work&quot; was that Microsoft stopped freely updating 7 to 10 like a year ago. The fact that this works means that they didnt really really stop whatever method they used to determine that users on 7 can upgrade. Your account will still be activated, HWIDGEN will just not work for new users in the future. If your account got deactivated, Microsoft would also have to deactivate all users who upgraded from 7 to 10 for free.Also, just a heads up, its not like a firmware upgrade that can ruin anything. Nothing will be bricked. When you dont activate Windows 10, you just get a nag notification bubble encouraging you to activate it. None of your files will ever be affected. This wont happen in your case though.\n",

Dont know what Microsoft does, but Ive re-installed Windows on machines that Ive used HWIDGEN on with no Microsoft account before and theyve always became activated after I connected to the internet.In general, HWIDGEN or not, big hardware changes like a new mobo or CPU deactivate windows because Microsoft thinks you have a new computer.\n",

I guess Ill be able to pair the license to a Microsoft account whenever the HWIDGEN license hack stops working so I can just use the account to activate the OS again after an eventual mobo replacement.Sweet.

Other people prefer to work on brand new stuff that interacts with old (and thats often an on-boarding strategy).  Others still just start tweaking on stuff in their own local branches to see what breaks (I do SOME of that, but I prefer to get into the mentality of &quot;why someone made it this way&quot; not just what it is).Most modern code-bases even if theyre huge theyre broken up into sub-components that can live on their own (precisely BECAUSE its so hard to onboard someone to a monolith), so try to get people to help you understand where the layers of separation are and then understand one component really well and expand from there.

You can also experiment with the “Feather Border” setting to see if you like what it does.When you click OK on that dialog, you should now see that your ellipse/circle appears to have a border, with dashed lines making up the inner and outer border edges.Make sure the foreground color is set to the color you want.Finally, click the Edit menu, and select the “Fill with FG Color” option.In Paint.NET:hit circle tooldraw circle\n",

Because you are mobile and can set up at high traffic intersections and pull up stakes and cater to concerts/festivals/sporting events/weddings/birthdays etc. So much more flexible. And the overhead is surely much lower. Youre not married to a single location or under contract and locked into a shitty lease. My mom ran a successful dougnut shop before the owner retired and my sister is going to open up a doughnut truck. She already has a very lucrative pet grooming business but she is getting tired of handling large dogs. Its bad for her back. It may be something we can split.

The staff will give a hearty, but not absurd “Irasshaimase!” when you enter. The wait staff will not except tips. I will only hire nice Christian girls who are genuinely happy to see the customer.

This restaurant would serve Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese style noodles at an affordable price. The likelihood of such a project would probably be very hard which is why it requires fuckyou money to hire a large team, a large plot of land to build such a place, and other expenses. It would be opened 24 hours with lots of teams of dedicated cooks switching shifts, etc.. This idea came to me one late night as I tend to crave wanting a tasty bowl of noodle soup but every place around me closes at the 10:00 PM to 11:00 PM time frame.

Drink list would also focus on strong, dark beers, with meads and other fun stuff like that.I realize that the idea of trying to run a fantasy restaurant as anything other than a gimmick is retarded, but ive always thought it would be cool.\n",

At 11 I took off work and went to McDonalds drive through. I was pissed. I asked again. Could I please have a McChicken with tomato on it, but they said they just cannot do that, they have no tomatoes. I pointed at the fucking burger that has a tomato in it and they said no, thats only for burger. What did I do?

One exception, at least until earlier this month in New York State, was wine and liquor sold in stores.Since Prohibition was repealed in 1933, New York has barred the sale of liquor on credit. But on Aug. 7, Governor Cuomo signed a bill that made an exception for credit-card sales, and now liquor store owners, liquor industry analysts and consumer psychologists say the sale of wine and spirits in New York State has entered the plastic age.The entire alcoholic beverage industry has been a one-holiday industry, Christmas, and only through the use of credit cards can the industry ever hope to open the door to the other holidays, said Peter J. Morrell, the wine adviser at Morrell &amp; Company, a wine and liquor store at 535 Madison Avenue (54th Street).

As time goes on, they tend to cut corners (Removing nicer items, cheeping out on ingredients, changing to cheaper vendors) and raise the price. At the same time, you have the local population stating to learn about said buffet and starting to ruin it with shitty behavior. For example: Ryans a good 15+ years ago was a pretty decent chain and had a lot of decent stuff. Over time, they slowly started to lose money and started to cheapen out. The local one was closed, and I was dragged to one back around 2014 that was still operational. No joke, it was near inedible and I rarely had that issue with buffets. Golden Corral is similar, but in this case it was more because entire families would act like shitheads and it became more tedious (and more expensive) to eat there then to just go to a normal sit down restaurant. Hell, remember Ponderosa back in the 90s? Same thing happened to them that Ryans had happen later. Its a circle, and one that will only get worse with the virus.

By arrangement, Huy Fong would prepay Underwood Ranches for each years harvest so as to cover the production costs, but in the fall of 2016 they demanded that Underwood Ranches repay them over $1 million of what they claimed to have been an over-payment for that years harvest. When Underwood disputed this charge, this put the two companies on such bad terms that they ceased their long-standing business partnership, thus forcing Huy Fong to find a new source of peppers for its sriracha (via Eater). Wherever they are currently sourcing their jalapenos from, these peppers obviously dont taste exactly the same as the Underwood Ranches ones. This change alone is what has caused Huy Fong sriracha to taste different now than it did just a few years ago. In July 2019, the state of California finally determined that Underwood Ranches was the winner. The Los Angeles Times reported they were awarded a $23.3 million dollar settlement to be paid by Huy Fong Foods, although Huy Fong has vowed to appeal the verdict.\n",

Why wouldnt they be?OP, egg roll wrappers are clever ways for restaurants to add more crunchy variety to appetizer menus and use of leftovers at the same time, like rueben rolls, or your pic (mirroring other items on the menu). Ive had weird fillings like cuban egg rols that work very well, and not uncommonly, the one I see the most, and adore the most are the southwestern flavors, with hot and crispy avocado chunks inside. That texture of soft and crispy at the same time is excellent, some creamy dip to add zest to it.I often buy won ton skins and use them for pot stickers and won ton soup (I process a whole pork loin into the batches after coming home from a Costco). Ive made spring rolls from dried rice wrappers, at home many times, kind of a post-farmers market activity I do, and then park them in a container with wet paper towels and take them to work for 2 days in a row, but Ive never messed with egg roll wrappers at home.

They want to reduce the number of animals who have to endure horrific experiences living in cramped conditions and being slaughtered at a young age.Many people implicitly or explicitly believe that whats natural is good. Vegans reject this moral framework when its used to defend omnivorism on the grounds that humans are naturally omnivorous. Yet, animal-rights advocates are not always so quick to reject the appeal to nature when it comes to wild-animal suffering. Many of them are environmentalists; they harbor the false assumption that animals are happy in the wild, and would therefore support habitat preservation.Nature is not optimized for compassion; its optimized by the cold, harsh forces of evolution. Billions of wild vertebrates and quadrillions of wild invertebrates are suffering right now across the globe. This is an urgent tragedy.Some insect species have life expectancies at birth measured in days or weeks, and most deaths are quite painful. It seems likely that wild animals as a whole experience more suffering than happiness, in which case we would hope to prevent their births, just like vegans want to prevent the births of factory-farmed animals.80% of Amazon deforestation stems from cattle ranching. Given that rainforests are home to some of the highest densities of wild-animal populations (and hence wild-animal suffering) on Earth, this appears to be a consideration in favor of beef consumption.When cattle eat vegetation on pasture fields, they presumably leave less vegetation left over to be eaten by bugs (and other organisms). Hence, cattle grazing on the whole reduces bug populations (and therefore, bug suffering) on pasture fields.\n",

What kind of ethical farming are you talking about, anon?I’ve even got a fun story for you all. One summer I worked on a farm that did mixed organic and ‘conventional’ farming of a variety of crops and livestock. One organic fertilizer we would use for green beans was blood from the killing floor. They’d drive a tanker truck out to the field and we’d pump it through the sprinkler heads. Occasionally bits of brain or tissue would get stuck in the heads and you’d have to clear them by hand. In about an hour the truck would be empty and we’d flush the lines with water. By the end you’d be covered in pig blood. I often thought of the vegans and muslims that would feel so good about eating their pork blood beans.\n",

Though it depends whether youre comfortable with the more robust and darker low-grade white tea flavors or if you much prefer the sharp, crisp notes, in which case silver needle is probably the way to go.

Not wanting to waste that heat, theyd pop in some nearly 100% rye loaves (most often made with rye meal/chops/berries instead of flour) in covered containers and pull them out when they came back in the next day.The long bake completely caramelizes the sugars that are endemic in milled rye, turning the loaf almost black and making for an extremely potent flavor.\n",

Couverture chocolate is a colloquial term referring to a particular type of chocolate that is special type compared to other regular chocolate bases. It is the finest professional quality chocolate that is produced with the highest percentage of cocoa butter using premium cocoa beans. Couverture chocolate is grounded to a finer texture during the production process and that results in superior flavor and texture. It melts smoothly and gives an elegant glossy sheen when tempered. Couverture chocolate is ideal for molding, enrobing truffles and fine candy making.In America, the exact standards for couverture chocolate are not set but bittersweet chocolate in general must contain at least a minimum of 35% cocoa solids. That’s just the minimum amount, so real dark couverture chocolate used by professionals will contain more than the minimum. You’ll find couverture chocolate with at least 60% cocoa solids in most fancy restaurant kitchens.Looks like the only hard thing to do is making the powder extremely fine :^(\n",

The idea of it is to steep mostly the flavor compounds and not too much of other things in tea like caffeine and tannins that would make it bitter.

Brethren, the whores expression bares witness she is a mare bred for the lust of man, in which I gladly partook. Many nights did I spend in my chambers, I commissioned the work of fine painter artisans, French auteurs of literature, who made great works of art to commemorate her for men where they drink : &quot;As I looked down upon my wrath, she was smote across the linen&quot;. And where one foul deed is conceived so must another, the whore of Babylon has taken but ten fold the sins of one man. Thus marches the fool ever onward toward his rage, despite his grasp slipping on the toll paid before. Nay, such a simple principal, he has earned this cruel fate! A woman of God is fair and trim, not a grotesque glutton. She is silent and unseen, as a feline quietly nurses her young, your maiden must hold true to these virtues brothers. For your renown it must be this way, lest you break into a fit of rage! Henceforth, the time has past for myself, sin has taken me in the stables, although such a plump sow would fetch a fine coin, I hath not given the shirt off my back! Lesser men have sacrificed much for little. A quick summary of this tale, the fool doth earn his bed of hay. Sorry for bad english, i hope you get the message.\n",

The parole board got me into this halfway house called the Brewer, and a job bagging groceries at the Food-Way. Its hard work. I try to keep up, but my hands hurt most of the time. I dont think the store manager likes me very much. Sometimes after work I go to the park and feed the birds. I keep thinking Jake might just show up and say hello. But he never does. I hope wherever he is, hes doing okay and making new friends. I have trouble sleeping at night. I have -- bad dreams, like Im falling. I wake up scared. Sometimes it takes me a while to remember where I am. Maybe I should get me a gun and rob the Food-Way, so theyd send me home. I could shoot the manager while I was at it, sort of like a bonus. I guess Im too old for that sort of nonsense anymore. I dont like it here. Im tired of being afraid all the time. Ive decided not to stay. I doubt theyll kick up any fuss.

I appreciate theyre trying.What Im pissed about is that apparently the SCREENWRITING is wrong.

Id use that at least as a loose framework, with the overarching motive to get the TARDIS back or what have you. Itd have to be big budget so itd have a lot of spectacle like battles and stuff, but I somewhat imagine the individual stories to focus more on the various creations of the two sides (bioweapons, chemical weapons, missiles, robots, AI, genetically engineered creatures etc) with the main enemy being kept as a more overarching threat only encountered a couple of times before the finale, which would see them attack in force.\n",

            "One of my more developed ideas is about an episode where the TARDIS is struck by something in the Time Vortex and disabled, leaving the Doctor and co. to try and repair the damage, but its FUBAR. As the episode goes on, the Doctor would find rooms in the TARDIS he doesnt recognize, the hallway would display weird &quot;desktop themes&quot;, and the gang would get the sense that theres something(s) walking around the halls with them. Eventually, the Doctor realizes that the TARDIS has hit another TARDIS and the best chance at getting the Doctors TARDIS space/timeworthy again is taking repairing it with parts from the one they hit. As they attempt to find the other TARDIS console room, they find the things that have been stalking them. Im a bit torn between some kind of timewraiths or creatures mutated by the Time Vortex. Im leaning towards the former, as the latter is a bit too similar to Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS. 1/2\n",
            "Anyway, they get to the console room and find the source of the timewraiths, a Time Lord who has been driven insane and &quot;temporally fractured&quot; by the collision, the timewraiths being past future, or potential versions of him or her. The Doctor and co. grab the part they need from the console and the Doctor tells them to run back to his TARDIS and that hell be right behind them. He tries to reason with the fractured Time Lord to no avail, and it devolves into a bit of a brawl, campy Venusian aikido optional. After a bit of the fight, during which the Doctor is rather badly wounded, the Time Lord is thrown out the front door of his TARDIS into the Time Vortex. Heartbroken by what he had to do, the Doc runs after his companions, repairs his TARDIS, and dematerializes, leaving the other TARDIS to drift in the vortex as a ghost ship. The wound he suffered during the fight, in my mind, would be a bit too much to come back from, so the rest of the season deals with the Doctor coming to terms with his mortality and inevitable death, hopefully dealt with better than the 2008-10 specials. 2/2\n",

            "Love your idea. If I could offer a change -- sorry if you dont give a fuck, but:Less is more. Forget time wraiths and fractured Time Lords. Make the other TARDIS the enemy. Say her Time Lord died. That TARDIS is sending projections or monsters or whatever into the Doctors TARDIS. The Doctor sees images or video recordings of this other Time Lord and sees the bond he had with his ship. The Doctor is forced to steal parts from this TARDIS in order to save his own and his companions (which is the moral justification). Focus more on the emotional aspect than just the sci-fi bit -- not to say that you dont already, because the way that it affects the Doctor in your summary is great.Its just that something about a sick Time Lord attacking doesnt feel as heartbreaking as establishing his bond between him and his TARDIS and then making that TARDIS like a lost dog without its master.

It was such a high budget and that was his first movie with ANY budget to speak of, and worst of all, it was being produced by Dino DeLaurentis, which if you didnt know is one of the Jewiest old Jews in Hollywood and pretty much ruined almost every movie he ever had a hand in except for the first Conan. Lynch wanted a 3 hour runtime for Dune and DeLaurentis insisted on cutting it down to 2 hours. And the whole problem with that movie was that everything was so unbelievably rushed. The visuals were outstanding, but there was no time for character development or worldbuilding whatsoever, so the movie was just weird random shit happening for no discernible reason to people you dont know and dont care about. Thats also the reason why half the story was told in voice-over narration. There wasnt time to give exposition in any other way. Lynch was so butthurt about what happened with Dune, he refused to ever direct a big-budget mainstream movie again.I really dont think its entirely fair to blame him. I think the amazing thing about Dune is that if anybody else had done it, it would have been EVEN WORSE, which beggars belief.\n",

Revisit them after I seen more important and relevant films? Or should I tough it out and stick to every film.So far I have seen:Godzilla (1954)Godzilla Raids Again (1955)Rodan (unfinished)Rodan took me multiple sittings and then my rental ran out. Next on the list is Varan who I also never heard of. So I’m considering skipping to Mothra since I know that monster is important. Are these other monsters ever referenced again? I know Mothra is important so I definitely will watch that one. But I’m not sure about these other guys.\n",

Enjoy the classic kaiju action.\n",

Like when aliens are involved but they are just guys in weird hats, or guys who are actually planet of the apes ripoff ape men, or that one where it was implied that the alien dudes were really giant insects? The Showa films all have kind of an lsd edge, like youre seeing the aesthetics of the western drug counterculture filtered through the prude Japanese cultural lens. Everything from the music to the bizarrely contrived schemes of the bad guys in the later stuff has this surreal quality. Its all super shitty but it really does have its own flavor.\n",

            "If the entire Last Airbender production can be compared to a set of disastrous dominoes, then the first terrible piece put in play was the casting of Nicola Peltz as Katara. The source says that her hiring was purely due to nepotism – as her father is a billionaire and CEO of an influential alternative investment management fund. The author says that &quot;her audition tape was subpar at best,&quot; but that it didn’t ultimately matter in any way.From this point, the producers had to find an actor to play Sokka, and because he is Katara’s brother they had to base their casting decision on who would look like a relative of Nicola Peltz (are you starting to see the domino effect?). Enter Jackson Rathbone. Unlike Peltz, the Twilight actor did put on a good show during his audition and could have been a great match for all of the humor in earlier drafts of the script. Of course, the producers found those moments of humor were taking too much time away from the story, and they were axed.This then led to complications casting the role of Prince Zuko, the film’s central antagonist. The production had originally hired Jesse McCartney to play the part because he was going to be the only possibly recognizable name in the main cast. Then the producers realized that they were casting all white kids in an anime-esque adaptation, and that they needed to introduce some diversity. This was how Dev Patel entered the picture, as he had just won rave reviews for his part in Danny Boyle’s Slumdog Millionaire. This idea backfired when the entire Fire Nation casting had to be based on Patel’s casting. This, as the message board writer puts it, &quot;is why it turned into heroic white kids VS evil brown people.&quot;\n",
